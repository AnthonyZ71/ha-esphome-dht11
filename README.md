# Remote DHT11 for home-assistant using esphome

The remote DHT11 project is an ESPHome/Home-Assistant integration to record temperature and humidity readings.

It includes all of the details to wire the components and includes a 3D-printed case to hold the components

## Instructions

- Using a chromium-based browser, navigate to https://anthonyz71.github.io/ha-esphome-dht11/
- Install the firmware on the ESP32 device.
  - In the case of the devices linked in the description, most of the time just pressing `I00` button was enough to flash the device.  Occasionally, the device requires pressing `EN` followed by `I00`.
